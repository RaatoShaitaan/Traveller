                            on the prowl. The wetlands of the Koshi Tappu Reserve are a bird watchers delight. Up in the 
                            mountains of Manang, you can follow the trail of the mountain goats, yaks and the elusive snow 
                            leopard. Wake up to the sounds of the forest and sink into the evening with an amazing sunset.</p>

                            <p> Any time is momo time. Momos are traditional dumplings that can be found in remote tea houses and with 
                            equal élan at high end restaurants. From freshly caught river fish to dried smoky meats and yak cheese, from 
                            freshly grown garden vegetables and herbs to crunchy mountain apples, from home brewed spirits to the beautiful 
                            selection of teas, there’s a whole lot waiting for your palate to discover.</p>

                            <p>Nepal can be a journey of true self discovery. The smell of incense, prayer flags in the wind, the chime of 
                            distant bells, butter lamps, the rotation of prayer wheels and mystical chants permeate centers of spiritual learning,
                            monasteries and temples.</p>
                            <p>The birthplace of Buddha and the abode of Shiva, Nepal is a divine experience. Meditation, yoga, a temple stay or a 
                            spiritual sojourn, it draws believers and free thinkers alike.</p>

                            silver and metal ware to stone carvings, wood works and paintings, there is something magical in the hand crafted products
