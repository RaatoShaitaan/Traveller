                    <p>Kathmandu, the cap0.ital and largest city in Nepal, is like no other city in the world.
                    The decaying buildings in the heart of the city are a contrast to the lively atmosphere that 
                    permeates the streets. The smell of incense wafts from the stores while street sellers push 
                    their wares, and people go about their daily lives, all against a backdrop of historic temples 
                    and carved statues.</p>
                    <p>For several hundred years, Kathmandu was one of three rival royal cities, along with Bhaktapur 
                    and Patan. Situated in close proximity to each other, today these three almost run together. The highlight 
                    of Kathmandu has long been Durbar Square, the largest of the palace squares in the three royal cities and a                                 UNESCO World Heritage Site. Temples and monuments of varying shapes, sizes, styles, and faiths can be found 
                    here.</p>
                    <p>Kathmandu's Durbar Square was severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake, with many buildings 
                    destroyed beyond repair.</p>

                    <p>Patan is one of the largest cities in Nepal and is located just across the Bagmati river 
                    from Kathmandu. Many locals still call the city by its original Sanskrit name of Lalitpur (City of Beauty) or 
                    by its Newari name, Yala. Almost everyone who comes to Kathmandu also visits Patan’s spectacular 
                    Durbar Sqyare – even after the 2015 earthquake, this remains the finest collection of temples 
                    and palaces in the whole of Nepal.</p>

                    <p>Bhaktapur, the third of the "Royal Cities,", just outside of Kathmandu. Bhaktapur, a trade 
                    route was both an arterial link and major source of wealth. Its relative remoteness at the 
                    time allowed the city to develop independently and in ways which distinguish it from the 
                    other two cities. In contrast to Patan and Kathmandu, the population of Bhaktapur is primarily 
                    Hindu. The best place from which to begin a tour of the city is Durbar Square, where in addition 
                    to the royal palace, several temples are also situated. The whole area is a UNESCO World Heritage 
                    Site.</p>
                    <p>Many of the buildings in Durbar Square in Bhaktapur were damaged in the 2015 earthquake.</p>

                    <p>Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Pashupatinath is one of the four most important religious sites in 
                    Asia for devotees of Shiva. Built in the 5th century and  later renovated by Malla kings, the 
                    site itself is said to have existed from the beginning of the millennium when a Shiva lingam was 
                    discovered here.</p>
                    <p>The largest temple complex in Nepal, it stretches on both sides of the Bagmati River which is 
                    considered holy by Hindus.  The main pagoda style temple has a gilded roof, four sides covered in 
                    silver, and exquisite wood carvings. Temples dedicated to several other Hindu and Buddhist deities 
                    surround the the temple of Pashupatinath.</p>

                <div class="col-6">
                    <p>Cremation of Hindus take place on raised platforms along the river. Only Hindus are allowed through 
                    the gates of the main temple. The inner sanctum has a Shiva lingam and facing the temple sits the largest 
                    statue of Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Shiva. There are hundreds of Shiva lingamswithin the compound. 
                    The big Maha Shivaratri festival in spring attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees from within Nepal 
                    and from India. Further east before the Bagmati reaches Pashupati is the temple of Guheshwori dedicated 
                    to Shiva's consort Sati Devi.</p>
                    <p>Pashupatinath Temple is one of the eight UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites of the Kathmandu Valley.  
                    It is also a cremation site where the last rites of Hindus are performed. The rituals of cremation 
                    is not for the faint hearted; still visitors are seen watching curiously from across the river from 
                    the hillside</p>

                    <p>Set on a hilltop to the west of Kathmandu, Swayambhunath is the second most important shrine 
                    in the Kathmandu Valley after Boudhanath. Due to the resident monkeys that inhabit parts of the 
                    temple, it is more affectionately known as the Monkey Temple. The Swayambhu Stupa, painted with 
                    the eyes of the omnipresent god, forms the centerpiece of the temple complex. It was originally 
                    a prehistoric cult site, but the temple complex dates to the 5th century. Swayambhu plays a major 
                    part in the lives of the Vajrayana Buddhists of Northern Nepal and Tibet, but especially of the                     
                    Newari Buddhists of the Kathmandu Valley.</p>

                    some of the highest mountains in the world - Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Annapurna I. For many trekkers,
                    Pokhara is the gateway to the Himalayas. It is the starting point for treks to Jomsom and the 
                    Annapurna region. But visitors will enjoy Pokhara and the beautiful scenery even if they are not

                    <p>By population, it is the second largest town in Nepal after Kathmandu but still does not 
                    feel like a big city. People coming from the Kathmandu Valley notice the much cleaner air and 
                    pleasant climate almost immediately. Lake Phewa, with its cluster of lakeside hotels, restaurants,
                    and shops, is ideal for those looking for relaxation and for day excursions.</p>

                    <p>A tour in the lap of the highest peak of the world, known to everyone, would certainly fulfill 
                    the desire inside an adventurous being. The breathtaking view of mountains in front of eyes is what 
                    we expect from this tour. The tour begins with a flight to Lukla which would also provide some 
                    adventure, followed by trekking. The trekking through the rhododendron forest and snowy land lead 
                    to a magical journey. The journey shows beauty in the mountains of Nepal as well as the richness 
                    in the culture of Sherpa. The path along with the people and the structure of the Sherpa land would 
                    add excitement in the tour.</p>
